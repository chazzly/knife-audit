# Get the :seen_recipes list and save it to a permanent attribute.  This is in a ruby_block so that it runs
# during execute phase, that way :seen_recipes is complete since it is populated during compile phase.  Once
# this has been placed in an attribute, the end-of-run node.save will save it so that knife audit can get
# the node's full runlist from the chef server.
